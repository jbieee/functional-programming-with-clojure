# functional-programming-with-clojure

This is a small project I completed by following along with this git repo, https://github.com/technomancy/mire, which builds
the project step by step w/ git branches to discover and learn some of the basics and power behind Clojure.

Its a multiplayer text adventure game, not that fun to play, but it was fun to build.
